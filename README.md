Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network):

Recommended Model: COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x
Reasoning: Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone is optimized for object detection and can effectively handle small to medium-sized objects. This model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which includes various objects at different scales. It provides a good balance of accuracy and speed for detecting localized features like signatures.
