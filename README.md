Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network):

Recommended Model: COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x
Reasoning: Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone is optimized for object detection and can effectively handle small to medium-sized objects. This model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which includes various objects at different scales. It provides a good balance of accuracy and speed for detecting localized features like signatures.

Mask R-CNN (with Instance Segmentation):

Recommended Model: COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x
Reasoning: Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks, which can improve the localization accuracy. Although you may not need segmentation masks, this model's instance-level detection capabilities are beneficial for tasks where precise bounding box localization is critical.
RetinaNet (for Dense Object Detection):

Recommended Model: COCO-Detection/retinanet_R_50_FPN_3x
Reasoning: RetinaNet is a single-stage object detector that performs well with smaller objects. Its Focal Loss mechanism helps improve detection for sparse objects like signatures in complex backgrounds. This model is faster than the R-CNN models and may be suitable if you want a quicker inference time without sacrificing much accuracy.


You could start with Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN as they provide higher accuracy for object detection tasks, and then consider RetinaNet if you need faster performance.
